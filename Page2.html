                    <h2>For the win!</h2>
                    <p>I love playing boardgames and quizes. I think its a real nice way to spend time togeheter with people, not only to have fun with your friends but also to get to know people. 
                    If you are meeting new people, I think that's it's easy to feel insecure and selfaware. But if you are playing a game I feel that you shift your focus to something else, which makes you more relaxed. 
                    And let's face it, you do have more fun! ðŸ˜„ <br /> <br /> I think that my favorit boardgame is "Alias". It's the game where you under a limited time have to explain a word and your team without saying the actuall word. 
                    Its easy rules, it's really stressfull, and people say the funniest things when they are stressed. Also, seing people being frustrated is quite fun. ðŸ¤­ <br /> <br/>Another game I like is Pandemic. I love that it's a 
                    cooperative stratetic game, where you are trying to save the world from a disease that is spreading. Every person has it's own special abilities so you need everyone to succeed. You either win or loose togheter, and
                    shared joy is the best kind of joy!</p>
