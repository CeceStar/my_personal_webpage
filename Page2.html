                    <h3>Boardgames and quizes</h3>
                    <p>I love playing boardgames and quizes. I think its a real nice way to spend time togeheter with people, not only to have fun with your friends but also to get to know people. 
                    If you are meeting new people, I think that's it's easy to feel insecure and selfaware. But if you are playing a game I feel that you shift your focus to something else, which makes you more relaxed. 
                    And let's face it, you do have more fun! ðŸ˜„ I think that my favorit boardgame is "Alias". It's the game where you under a limited time have to explain a word and your team without saying the actuall word. 
                    Its easy rules, it's really stressfull, and people say the funniest things when they are stressed. Also, seing people being frustraded is quite fun ðŸ¤­ . Another game I like is Pandemic. I love that it's a 
                    cooperative stratetic game, where you are trying to save the world from a disease that is spreading. Every person has it's own special abilities so you need everyone to succeed. You either win or loose togheter, and
                    shared joy is the best kind of joy!</p>

                    <h3>Fantasy Books</h3>
                    <p>Where to being! My all time favourite book is "His dark material"-triology. I remembere reading the first book in just one day, I never let it go! The second book, I "took it a bit easy" and finished
                        in one week. The last book, i had to live more of a normal life, my parents got worried! So, took about 1 month. I loved every minute. I was so well written, so intresting, and so many layers that
                        you might not notice at first. I would love to have my own Daemon, an animal that is basically your soul, that follows you around and can't be to far away from without it hurting you. Such a romantic
                        view of your soul.
                    </p>
                    <p>I can't talk about favourite Fantasybooks without mentioning Harry Potter. What a book-serie! The first two books my father read out loud to me and my brother. It was so cozy, and we were so involved
                        in the story, it got harder to get ut to go to sleep. The third book, we were old enough to wanting to read ourselves. I love the magical world she describes to us. It's so detailt but at the same time
                        always brings the story forward. It's smart that they are in the school during most of the books, which makes it easier to "explain the magical world" to us readers, whitout us thining about it. 
                        I remember reading until book number five, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, then i got so upset I decided that nope, this was it, I can't handle whats happening! I think it took me five years until I actually
                        read the last three books haha! But loved them anyway. I also think that she, the author, have been supersmart to write the books so you can "grow" with the books. The language and story is much easier to read in the
                        first books, then gets more and more advanced and "scarier". Fantastic writing!
                    </p>
                    <p>The last bok I want to mention is not a bookserie, but the book "Ready player one". If any fellow nerd haven't read that book, I urge you to do it! Not only is it a complete nostalgic 80's video game 
                        and popculture fiesta, it's also tells a very interesting story about a future dystopia. A dystopia that doesnt seem so far away from reality to my opinion! I loved to talk and and discuss that book, 
                        especially with this rapid technology we have today and with the growing online communities that already exist.

                    <h3>Tv-series</h3>
                    <p>I like to mix up my Tv-series whatching with some light and some more serious. The Big Bang theory and Modern family are two favourites, but also enjoied Suits and The newsroom alot. Game of thrones is ofc
                        not only a favourite, but also a modern classic. I enjoyed Once upon a time also, being very "light" and nostalgic, but maybe not the greates show. But good fun!

                <div class="Videogames">
                    <h3>Videogames</h3>
                    <p>My brother introduced me to videogames when we where young. We got a SNES and I enjoyed watching while he played, especially The Ledgend of Zelda - it was like a long movie that we togheter created. I think
                        that is the essense of what I love with some videogames, it's like long movies that you are a part of telling. I also think its so much fun to play VS games. Once I was older, me and my brother started to play
                        togheter. We played Teenage mutant ninja turtles alot, a cooperative game! It was better since he was so much better than me, haha! But then we played Street fighter and ofcourse Mariokart. The love for Nintento
                        consoles have never stoped, and I would say that have excelled in all the Super Mario games and Zelda games, love them so much.</p>
