# My first webpage in Hyper Island
### (Brief 1 *The fundameltals - Personal Website*)
This is a personal webpage about me. My first project for my Hyper Island studies. The assignment was just to create and HTML page and practice CSS. Its not much to show case, but i remember being proud of it. Proud to be able to create this in such short time, or just anything at all in code. Very fun to see how far I have come this past month.
